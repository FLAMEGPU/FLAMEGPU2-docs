Next Steps
==========

Now that you have successfully built and run a FLAMEGPU2 model, we recommend exploring the user guide and having a look at the source code for the circles model.

The source code is available in ``/src/main.cu``.

Once you are familiar with how the example works, have a go at modifying it or building your own model!

TODO: Perhaps link to tutorial from here as recommended next step?
