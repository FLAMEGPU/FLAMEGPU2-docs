Building with Visualisation
===========================

To use the visualisation features you must ensure that you have followed the instructions for Building
with visualisation enabled. 
If you wish to use your own visualiser, you can save the simulation state to disk as described in :ref:`Collecting Data`. 

Default Visualisation
---------------------

The default visualisation will render agents based on their `x`, `y` and `z` variables.
