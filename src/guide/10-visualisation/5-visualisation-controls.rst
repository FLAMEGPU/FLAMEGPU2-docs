Visualisation Controls
======================
The visualisation is controlled by with the mouse and ``W``/``A``/``S``/``D`` keys similar to FPS games. Additionally ``space`` and ``c`` can be used to ascend/descend. Similarly, ``q`` and ``e`` can roll the camera.
Clicking locks and releases the mouse from controlling the visualisation's camera.
Alternatively, if available a controller can be used to control the visualisation.

There are several additional controls which can be used.
